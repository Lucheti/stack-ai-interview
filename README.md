# Knowledge Base Creator

This project is a Next.js application that allows users to create and manage knowledge bases by integrating with various data sources. It showcases best practices in React and Next.js development, focusing on code quality, performance, and user experience.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Code Structure

- `app/`: Next.js app directory containing pages and API routes.
- `components/`: Reusable React components.
- `api/`: API service layer for data fetching and manipulation.
- `state/`: Recoil atoms and selectors for state management.
- `styles/`: Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration.

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized component rendering to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
- Implemented code splitting and lazy loading for improved initial load times.
- Utilized Next.js Image component for optimized image loading.
